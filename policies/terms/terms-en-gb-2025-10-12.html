        <h1>Terms of Use for QR‑Ixonity</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: 11 October 2025, 20:09 EEST • Version: 2025‑10‑12‑1</p>

        <p>These Terms of Use (hereinafter — the «Terms») govern your interaction with the QR‑Ixonity mobile application (Ixonity brand), web services, backend infrastructure, and associated features (hereinafter — the «Service»), which are provided by Individual Entrepreneur Zaitsev Oleksii Yuriyovych (hereinafter — «We», «Us», «Controller»). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree — discontinue use. We strive to make these rules maximally clear and fair.</p>

        <h2>1. General Provisions</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>Use of the Service signifies your full agreement with these Terms and our Privacy Policy (available in the app). Both documents are legally binding. We reserve the right to update the Terms. We notify of substantial changes in the application with a new date marker. Continued use after changes signifies your agreement.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Purpose of the Service</h3>
        <p>QR‑Ixonity is intended for the creation, styling, and analysis of QR codes for personal or commercial purposes. We are not responsible for the manner in which you use the created codes, if this violates the law.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Language and Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>These Terms are available in the languages of the European Union, as well as the official languages of the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, and other countries. In case of discrepancies, the version in your native language or English shall prevail, unless otherwise specified.
        To avoid ambiguities, in the event of a conflict between localised versions, the English-language version of these Terms shall have priority, unless otherwise explicitly provided by local legislation.</p>

        <p>Jurisdiction depends on your place of residence: Ukraine (Law of Ukraine «On Protection of Consumer Rights»), European Union (GDPR), Great Britain (UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018), USA (Federal Trade Commission Act, CCPA/CPRA), Canada (PIPEDA), as well as the relevant laws of other countries where you use the Service.</p>

        <h3>1.4 In-App Acceptance and Storage of Consents (consent logs)</h3>
        <p>During registration in the application, we display links to the current editions of these Terms and the Privacy Policy. You can view the documents directly in the application, after which you confirm consent by an explicit action (checkbox or button). We store a record of the acceptance (document type — Terms/Policy, version/date, locale, time of confirmation) in our server system (Firebase/Firestore) and locally in the application exclusively for the purpose of audit, confirmation of the lawfulness of processing, and fulfillment of legislative requirements.</p>

        <p>If we introduce substantial changes to these Terms, we will re-display the updated edition in the application and ask you to confirm consent. If you do not agree with the updates, discontinue use of the Service and/or delete your account.</p>

        <p><strong>Retention period for consent records:</strong> we store acceptance records for the duration of your account existence and up to 3 years after its deletion exclusively for the purposes of complying with legal requirements, auditing, and confirming provided consents; after the end of this period, the records are deleted or anonymised. The legal basis is the performance of the contract and/or our legitimate interest in ensuring confirmation of the lawfulness of processing. You may object to such processing by contacting us using the details specified in the documents.</p>

        <h2>2. Registration and Account</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Account Creation</h3>
        <p>Full access to features (QR code saving, analytics, synchronisation) requires an account via Firebase Auth (using email or sign-in through Apple ID; anonymous mode with limitations is possible if needed). You are responsible for the accuracy of the data provided and the security of your account credentials.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Anonymous Use</h3>
        <p>You can use the Service without registration, but this restricts access to data saving, synchronisation, and analytics. Anonymous data is deleted after the session ends, if not associated with an account.</p>

        <h3>2.3 User Obligations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not transfer your access to other persons.</li>
            <li>Notify us immediately of suspicious activity (email: ixonity@gmail.com).</li>
            <li>Do not use automated scripts for mass account creation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.4 Account Deletion</h3>
        <p>You can delete your account via settings (/me/delete). This will lead to the irreversible deletion of all your data, including QR codes, associated statistical records, files in Storage, usage records, and device tokens. Before deletion, we recommend exporting important information.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> deleting an account in the application does not lead to the automatic cancellation of an active subscription. You can cancel auto-renewal and manage your subscription in your Apple ID settings (Settings → Your Name → Subscriptions).</p>

        <h3>2.5 QR Code Analytics (optional, in paid plans)</h3>
        <p>QR code analytics (e.g., scan statistics) is an optional feature, available in paid subscriptions — Business, Pro, Ultra. It is activated exclusively upon your explicit consent (opt‑in) through the «Enable Scan Statistics» toggle in the settings of a specific QR code. For EU/UK/EEA users, analytics are carried out only on the basis of your consent as the QR code owner. Scanner data is anonymised and aggregated; the IP address is used once to determine the country/city and is not stored. You can cease the collection of analytics by disabling it for the QR code or by deleting the specific QR code, which automatically deletes all associated statistical data from our backend (Firebase). We do not use IDFA and do not carry out «tracking» in the sense of Apple ATT.</p>

        <h2>3. Licence and Ownership Rights</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Licence to the User</h3>
        <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable licence to use the Service in accordance with these Terms. You may create QR codes for personal or commercial use, but you do not have the right to resell or modify the application itself.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Your Content</h3>
        <p>You retain the rights to the created QR codes, their designs (logos, frames), and associated links. We do not claim intellectual property over your content, but we obtain the right to process it for the provision of services (storage on servers, delivery, etc.).</p>

        <h3>3.3 Our Rights</h3>
        <p>All rights to the software, interface design, and QR‑Ixonity logos belong to us. You may not copy, distribute, or carry out reverse engineering of the code without written permission.</p>

        <h2>4. Use of the Service</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Permitted Actions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create, customise, and share QR codes.</li>
            <li>Activate analytics to track scans (if corresponding access is available).</li>
            <li>Use the Service for lawful purposes, including marketing, education, or personal projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Prohibited Actions</h3>
        <p>You do not have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service to distribute unlawful content (violence, fraud, phishing, piracy).</li>
            <li>Overload the servers with mass requests or bots.</li>
            <li>Damage the functionality of the Service (including through malicious software).</li>
            <li>Use QR codes to deceive or mislead users.</li>
            <li>Create QR codes that lead to content which breaches human rights, intellectual property, privacy, or other legal rights, including, but not limited to, discrimination, hatred, exploitation, defamation, or the dissemination of false information causing harm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Moderation</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Block accounts or delete content that violates these Terms. Users will be notified of the blocking or deletion via email or in the app, and have the right to appeal the decision by contacting ixonity@gmail.com within 14 days.</li>
            <li>Cooperate with law enforcement agencies when legal requests are present.</li>
            <li>Temporarily restrict access during technical updates (we notify of substantial updates via push notifications or email if it affects access to the Service).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Technical Limitations</h3>
        <p>The Service is provided «as is». We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation or the absence of errors given the dependence on third-party platforms (Google Firebase, Apple). In case of failures, we make efforts to eliminate them.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Indirect Damages</h3>
        <p>We are not responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of data due to incorrect input or account deletion by the user.</li>
            <li>Losses caused by the use of QR codes (for example, if a link leads to a malicious website).</li>
            <li>Incorrect interpretation of analytics due to technical specificities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Maximum Liability</h3>
        <p>Our liability is limited to the sum of your expenses for the Service (if any) and does not exceed 1000 Hryvnia (or the equivalent in your currency). This limitation does not apply if it is prohibited or restricted by mandatory consumer protection legislation in your jurisdiction, particularly in cases of intentional acts or gross negligence.</p>

        <h2>6. Disputes and Conflict Resolution</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Pre-Trial Settlement</h3>
        <p>Before applying to court, contact us by email: ixonity@gmail.com. We will review your complaint within 14 working days and attempt to find a solution.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>Disputes are resolved in the courts of your country of residence in accordance with local laws, specifically, the courts at the consumer's place of residence (if provided for by local legislation).

You can also contact supervisory authorities (see section 9).</p>

        <h3>6.3 Arbitration</h3>
        <p>For users outside the country of residence, dispute resolution through arbitration under UNCITRAL rules is possible if both parties agree.</p>

        <p>We may update, modify, or discontinue the Service (fully or partially). In case of discontinuation, we will provide a reasonable time (not less than 30 days) for data export.</p>

        <h2>8. Communication with Users</h2>
        <h3>8.1 Push Notifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A single iOS/iPadOS system permission for notifications is used. If you grant it, we can deliver technically necessary notifications (for example, about scan milestones, service messages about limits/subscription status).</li>
            <li>You can change the permission at any time in the device's system settings (Settings → Notifications) or disable individual milestone thresholds in the «Notifications» section inside the application.</li>
            <li>Marketing push notifications are currently not sent. If such an option appears in the future, it will only be available after your separate explicit consent (opt‑in) in the application; you can opt-out at any time.</li>
            <li>The device token is used exclusively for delivering notifications via Apple/FCM and is not applied for advertising tracking or profile building.</li>
        </ul>
