    <h1>QR‑Ixonity Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: October 11, 2025, 20:09 EEST • Version: 2025‑10‑12‑1</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use (hereinafter — «Terms») govern your interaction with the QR‑Ixonity mobile application (Ixonity brand), web services, backend infrastructure, and related features (hereinafter — «Service»), provided by Private Entrepreneur Zaitsev Oleksii Yuriyovych (hereinafter — «We», «Us», «Controller»). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree — stop using the Service. We strive to make these rules as clear and fair as possible.</p>

    <h2>1. General Provisions</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Acceptance of Terms</h3>
    <p>Use of the Service means your full agreement with these Terms and our Privacy Policy (available in the app). Both documents are legally binding. We reserve the right to update the Terms. We will notify you of significant changes in the application with an indication of the new date. Continued use after changes means your agreement.</p>
    <h3>1.2 Purpose of the Service</h3>
    <p>QR‑Ixonity is intended for creating, styling, and analyzing QR codes for personal or commercial purposes. We are not responsible for the way you use the created codes if it violates the law.</p>
    <h3>1.3 Language and Jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>These Terms are available in the languages of the European Union, as well as the official languages of the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, and other countries. In case of discrepancies, the version in your native language or English prevails, unless otherwise specified. Jurisdiction depends on your place of residence: Ukraine (Law of Ukraine «On Consumer Rights Protection»), European Union (GDPR), United Kingdom (UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018), USA (Federal Trade Commission Act, CCPA/CPRA), Canada (PIPEDA), as well as relevant laws of other countries where you use the Service.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Acceptance in the Application and Storage of Consents (consent logs)</h3>
    <p>During registration in the application, we display links to the current versions of these Terms and the Privacy Policy. You can review the documents directly in the application, after which you confirm consent by explicit action (checkbox or button). We store a record of acceptance (document type — Terms/Policy, version/date, locale, time of confirmation) in our server system (Firebase/Firestore) and locally in the application solely for audit purposes, confirming the lawfulness of processing, and complying with legal requirements.</p>
    <p>If we make significant changes to these Terms, we will re-display the updated version in the application and ask you to confirm consent. If you do not agree to the updates, discontinue using the Service and/or delete your account.</p>
    <p><strong>Retention period for consent records:</strong> we store records of acceptance for the duration of your account's existence and up to 3 years after its deletion solely for the purposes of complying with legal requirements, auditing, and confirming provided consents; after this period, the records are deleted or anonymized. The legal basis is the performance of the contract and/or our legitimate interest in ensuring confirmation of the lawfulness of processing. You can object to such processing by contacting us using the contacts specified in the documents.</p>

    <h2>2. Registration and Account</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Account Creation</h3>
    <p>Full access to features (saving QR codes, analytics, synchronization) requires an account via Firebase Auth (using email or Apple ID sign-in; anonymous mode with limitations is possible if needed). You are responsible for the accuracy of the data provided and the security of your credentials.</p>
    <h3>2.2 Anonymous Use</h3>
    <p>You can use the Service without registration, but this limits access to data saving, synchronization, and analytics. Anonymous data is deleted after the session ends, unless associated with an account.</p>
    <h3>2.3 User Obligations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not transfer your access to other persons.</li>
      <li>Notify us immediately of suspicious activity (email: ixonity@gmail.com).</li>
      <li>Do not use automated scripts for mass account creation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.4 Account Deletion</h3>
    <p>You can delete your account through the settings (/me/delete). This will result in the irreversible deletion of all your data, including QR codes, associated statistical records, files in Storage, usage records, and device tokens. We recommend exporting important information before deletion.</p>
    <h3>2.5 QR Code Analytics (optional, in paid plans)</h3>
    <p>QR code analytics (e.g., scan statistics) is an optional feature, available in paid subscriptions — Pro, Business, Ultra. It is activated exclusively with your explicit consent (opt‑in) via the «Enable scan statistics» switch in the settings of a specific QR code. For users in the EU/UK/EEA, analytics is carried out only based on your consent as the QR code owner. Scanner data is depersonalized and aggregated; the IP address is used once to determine the country/city and is not stored.
    You can stop collecting analytics by disabling it for the QR code or by deleting the specific QR code, which automatically deletes all associated statistical data from our backend (Firebase). We do not use IDFA and do not perform «tracking» in the sense of Apple ATT.</p>

    <h2>3. License and Property Rights</h2>
    <h3>3.1 License to the User</h3>
    <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable license to use the Service in accordance with these Terms. You may create QR codes for personal or commercial use but are not entitled to resell or modify the application itself.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Your Content</h3>
    <p>You retain the rights to the created QR codes, their designs (logos, frames), and associated links. We do not claim intellectual property over your content, but we receive the right to process it for the purpose of providing services (storage on servers, delivery, etc.).</p>
    <h3>3.3 Our Rights</h3>
    <p>All rights to the software, interface design, and QR‑Ixonity logos belong to us. You may not copy, distribute, or reverse engineer the code without written permission.</p>

    <h2>4. Use of the Service</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Permitted Actions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create, customize, and share QR codes.</li>
      <li>Activate analytics to track scans (if you have the corresponding access).</li>
      <li>Use the Service for lawful purposes, including marketing, education, or personal projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4.2 Prohibited Actions</h3>
    <p>You are not allowed to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service to distribute illegal content (violence, fraud, phishing, piracy).</li>
      <li>Overload servers with mass requests or bots.</li>
      <li>Damage the functionality of the Service (in particular, through malicious software).</li>
      <li>Use QR codes to deceive or mislead users.</li>
      <li>Create QR codes that lead to content violating human rights, intellectual property, privacy, or other legal rights, including, but not limited to, discrimination, hatred, exploitation, defamation, or dissemination of false information causing harm.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4.3 Moderation</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Block accounts or delete content that violates these Terms. Users will be notified of blocking or deletion via email or in the application and have the right to appeal the decision by contacting ixonity@gmail.com within 14 days.</li>
      <li>Cooperate with law enforcement agencies in the presence of legal requests.</li>
      <li>Temporarily limit access during technical updates (we notify of significant updates via push notifications or email if it affects access to the Service).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Technical Limitations</h3>
    <p>The Service is provided «as is.» We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation or absence of errors given the dependence on third-party platforms (Google Firebase, Apple). In case of failures, we make efforts to eliminate them.</p>
    <h3>5.2 Indirect Damages</h3>
    <p>We are not responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss of data due to incorrect input or user account deletion.</li>
      <li>Damages caused by the use of QR codes (e.g., if the link leads to a malicious website).</li>
      <li>Incorrect interpretation of analytics due to technical features.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5.3 Maximum Liability</h3>
    <p>Our liability is limited to the amount of your expenses for the Service (if any) and does not exceed 1000 hryvnias (or the equivalent in your currency). This limitation does not apply where it is prohibited or limited by mandatory consumer protection law in your jurisdiction, particularly in cases of intentional actions or gross negligence.</p>

    <h2>6. Disputes and Conflict Resolution</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Pre-trial Settlement</h3>
    <p>Before going to court, contact us via email: ixonity@gmail.com. We will review your complaint within 14 business days and try to find a solution.</p>
    <h3>6.2 Jurisdiction</h3>

For the Data Controller (Private Entrepreneur Zaitsev Oleksii Yuriyovych), the primary jurisdiction is the courts of the city of Odesa, Ukraine. You can also contact supervisory authorities (see section 9).</p>

    <h3>8.1 Push Notifications</h3>

      <li>You can change the permission at any time in the device system settings (Settings → Notifications) or disable individual milestone thresholds in the «Notifications» section within the application.</li>
      <li>Marketing push notifications are currently not sent. If such an option appears in the future, it will only be available after your separate explicit consent (opt‑in) in the application; you can opt-out at any time.</li>
