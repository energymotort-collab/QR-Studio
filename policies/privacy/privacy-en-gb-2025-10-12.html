    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <p>For clarity, the following terms are used in this Policy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Data — any information that directly or indirectly identifies a natural person (e.g., email address, unique identifier).</li>
      <li>User — a natural person who installs, registers for, and utilises the Service.</li>
      <li>Data Controller — the person who determines the purposes and means of data processing (in our case, Private Entrepreneur Zaytsev Oleksii Yuriyovych).</li>
      <li>Data Processor — a person or organisation that processes data on behalf of the Controller (e.g., Google Firebase or Apple).</li>
      <li>Sub-processors — third parties involved in data processing (see Section 13).</li>
      <li>Data Processing — any operation performed on personal data, including collection, storage, use, transfer, or deletion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Regulatory Framework and User Rights</h2>
    <p>We operate in accordance with the legislation mentioned above. Your fundamental rights as a data subject include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right of Access — to obtain a copy of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Right to Rectification — to correct inaccuracies in the data.</li>
      <li>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten) — to have your data deleted if it is no longer necessary.</li>

      <li>Right to Object — to object to processing based on legitimate interest.</li>
      <li>Right to Data Portability — to receive data in a structured format for transfer to another controller.</li>
      <li>Right to Non-Discrimination — we do not discriminate against users for exercising their rights (e.g., changing prices or access).</li>
      <li>Right to Lodge a Complaint — with a supervisory authority (see Section 21).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise your rights, please send a request to ixonity@gmail.com. We will perform identity verification and respond within the statutory timeframe (usually 30 days under GDPR, or 45 days with a possible extension to 90 days for complex requests under CCPA/CPRA).</p>
    <p><em>Additional clarification:</em> Consent for data processing (e.g., for push notifications or QR code analytics) is obtained through explicit confirmation (checkbox or button) and is not pre-checked. For push notifications, a panel requesting confirmation to receive notifications or to decline is displayed after the app is installed.</p>

    <h2>3. Data We Process and Why</h2>
    <h3>3.1. Account Data (after registration via Firebase Auth):</h3>
    <p>• Email address and unique user identifier (UID, Firebase ID).<br/>
        • Sign-in data via Apple (if selected).<br/>
        • Technical device tokens for push notifications (e.g., Firebase Registration Token, stored in the devices collection).<br/>
            Purpose: Authentication, user identification, and access recovery.</p>

    <h3>3.2. Subscription Data (via Apple StoreKit):</h3>
    <p>• Plan identifier (Pro, Business, Ultra), start/end date.<br/>
        • Subscription type, entitlements, and usage limits.<br/>
            Purpose: Subscription management, limit control for dynamic QR codes and API.</p>

    <h3>3.3. Notification Data (if permitted)</h3>
    <p>• What we store: APNs/FCM token of your device; notification settings (prefs), specifically scanning thresholds (10, 100, 10000, 50000).<br/>
        • How it works: a single iOS/iPadOS system permission; settings can be changed in Settings → Notifications or in the "Notifications" section.<br/>
        • Processing purpose: technically necessary notifications (milestones, limits/subscription status).<br/>
        • No tracking: the token is only for delivery via Apple/FCM, with no advertising tracking/profiling.<br/>
        • Marketing notifications: currently not sent; in the future — only with a separate opt-in.</p>

    <h3>3.4. QR Code Analytics (if activated by the user for paid features)</h3>
    <p>• We collect only **anonymised** aggregated statistics: country, city, device type (iOS/Android/Desktop), interface language, referrer, UTM, target **page**, date/time.<br/>
        • The IP is processed once for geo-matching and is not stored.<br/>
        • User-Agent is used to determine device type without personal identification.<br/>
            Purpose: Aggregated statistics to measure effectiveness. Optionality: Available in Pro/Business/Ultra and explicitly activated (opt-in) for a specific QR code; can be disabled at any time. IDFA/ATT are not used.</p>

    <h3>3.5. Technical Logs and Analytics</h3>
    <p>• Aggregated Firebase metrics (AppCheck) for performance **optimisation**.<br/>
        • Usage tracking: number of scans, API calls, dynamic codes created (monthly tracking).<br/>
            Purpose: Limit control, overload protection, billing, and auditing. Not used for behavioural tracking.</p>

    <h3>3.6. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and IDFA</h3>
    <p>• We do not use IDFA and do not perform "tracking" in the sense of Apple ATT.<br/>
        • The ATT system dialog is not displayed because we do not request tracking.<br/>
        • QR code analytics are **anonymised** and not linked to advertising profiles.</p>

    <h2>4. Data We DO NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>• Payment card information (processing handled exclusively by Apple).<br/>
        • Photos, documents, or other private user files.<br/>
        • GPS location, access to microphone/camera without direct user action.<br/>
        • Activity logs beyond the one-time use for QR analytics.</p>

    <h2>5. Sources of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>• Provided by you: contact information, notification settings.<br/>
        • Automatically collected: technical tokens, usage, **anonymised** scanning analytics (if activated).<br/>
        • From third parties: subscription data from Apple, authentication from Firebase/Apple.</p>

    <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>• Contract performance — account/subscriptions/limits, QR data storage, technically necessary notifications.<br/>
        • Legitimate interest — security, integrity, stability, auditing, and resource planning (with the right to object).<br/>
        • Consent — marketing pushes (if introduced, only opt-in), optional QR code analytics (opt-in).<br/>
        • Legal obligations — responding to legal requests, accounting/taxes.</p>

    <h2>7. Purpose of Processing</h2>
    <p>Authentication and identification; QR data storage; subscription and limit management; sending notifications; aggregated analytics; security, diagnostics, and **optimisation**.</p>

    <h2>8. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>Only strictly necessary cookies for authentication and functionality. If we add optional cookies, we will request consent and respect GPC signals.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Transfer and Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data is transferred only to vetted Sub-processors (DPA). Firebase is in the EU (europe-central2). Certain services may technically process data outside the EEA/UK; we apply SCC/DPF, conduct TIAs, and implement additional security measures.</p>

    <h3>9.1. Representative in the EU/UK (Art. 27 GDPR/UK GDPR)</h3>
    <p>If we systematically offer the Service to EU/UK residents or conduct targeted marketing, we will appoint a representative and update this section. Currently, no representative has been appointed.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>• Active account: We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the Service (authentication, QR data/settings storage, subscription, limits/quotas, notifications).</p>
    <p>• Deletion upon request: "Delete Account" in the application — complete deletion of all personal data and associated content under our control (Auth, QR links and statistics, files in Storage, prefs/devices, usage, entitlements). The process is automatic and usually takes seconds to minutes.</p>
    <p>• Backup and Processor Logs: After deletion, data may temporarily be stored as technical backups/logs by our processors (Google/Firebase) for up to 30–90 days; these copies are not available for operational use and are automatically destroyed.</p>
    <p>• Analytics and Usage: For active accounts, aggregated QR statistics and usage may be retained for up to 12 months for limits/auditing/**optimisation**; upon deletion of a QR code/account, associated data is deleted immediately.</p>
    <p>• Apple Subscription Logs: We do not store Apple transaction logs; we only keep the current plan status/entitlements, which is deleted along with the account.</p>
    <p>• Legal Obligations: If the law requires us to retain certain data longer (accounting, etc.), we retain the minimum necessary amount and only for the period explicitly stipulated by law.</p>

    <h3>10.1 Consent Logs and Retention Periods</h3>
    <p>Upon registration, we display links to the current versions of the Policy and Terms of Use. You can review the documents directly in the application, after which you confirm consent with an explicit action (checkbox or button). We retain records of your granted consents (document type: Policy/Terms, version/date, locale, time of acceptance) in Firebase/Firestore and locally in the application solely to confirm the legality of processing and comply with legal requirements. Such records are retained for the duration of your account's existence and up to 3 years after its deletion; after this period, the records are deleted or **anonymised**.</p>

    <h3>10.2 Legal Basis for Storing Consent Records</h3>
    <p>The storage of consent logs is carried out based on the performance of the contract and/or our legitimate interest in ensuring confirmation of the legality of processing and compliance with data protection laws. You can object to such processing by contacting us using the contact details provided in this Policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Security and Incidents</h2>
    <p>Encryption (SSL/TLS, HTTPS), Firebase App Check, access control, MFA, auditing. In case of incidents, we notify you and the authorities (e.g., within 72 hours under GDPR). Data is encrypted in transit and "at rest" (AES-256 on Firebase servers).</p>

    <h2>12. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>Available in the application interface (/me/delete). Deletes: account, QR codes, statistics, files in Storage, usage, tokens. Data is non-recoverable. Deleting an individual QR code also automatically deletes related data (including scan statistics) from our backend.</p>

    <h2>13. Key Sub-processors</h2>
    <p>Google Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage, Messaging, Hosting); Apple (StoreKit, APNs); QR landing page hosting providers. A full list is available upon request.</p>

    <h2>14. User Content and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>Rights to QR codes belong to the users. Illegal content is prohibited; moderation and cooperation with authorities are possible.</p>

    <h2>15. Additional Provision for California Users (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
    <p>We do not "sell" data. Rights: Access, Deletion, Opt-Out. Contact channels: <a href="mailto:ixonity@gmail.com">ixonity@gmail.com</a>. You can opt out of QR code analytics by deleting the QR code in the application or by sending a request.</p>

    <h2>16. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children; the minimum age is 17+ or the age of consent in your jurisdiction. Detected child accounts will be deleted. Parents/guardians can contact <a href="mailto:ixonity@gmail.com">ixonity@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>17. Changes to the Policy</h2>
    <p>We will notify you of changes within the application/on the website 14 days before they take effect. Continued use = consent.</p>

    <h2>18. Compliance with Apple Requirements (Privacy Manifest)</h2>
    <p>The application includes a Privacy Manifest that describes the data collected (email, device identifiers, **anonymised** QR code analytics) and its purpose in accordance with this Policy. Consents obtained within the application are recorded solely to confirm the legality of processing and are not used for advertising targeting.</p>

    <h2>19. Automated Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>We do not use automated decision-making in the sense of GDPR (Art. 22). QR code analytics are **anonymised** and do not affect user rights/obligations. Moderation involves human review.</p>

    <h2>20. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for delays or inability to process data due to force majeure events (natural disasters, wars, strikes, cyberattacks, outages of third-party platforms). In such cases, we will notify you via push/email and take steps to restore service.</p>

    <h2>21. Contact and Supervisory Authorities</h2>
